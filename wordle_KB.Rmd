# Creating a Wordle Game
The rules of Wordle are simple: A player has SIX tries to guess a 5-letter word that has been selected at random from a list of possible words. Guesses need to be valid 5-letter words. After each guess, a player receives feedback about how close their guess was to the word, which provides information they can use to try to solve the puzzle. This feedback lets you know whether each letter your guess is either [1] in the solution word and in the correct spot, [2] in the solution word but in the wrong position, or [3] not in the solution word. In app/browser versions of Wordle, this feedback is provided visually using colors, but that need not be the case.

## Step 1
- Create your own custom function called load_dictionary() that takes a single argument, “filename”, that can be used to read in either of the two data files your downloaded.

- Once you have created your function, use that function to create two variables, solution_list and valid_list, that, respectively contain vectors of possible solution words and valid words to guess. That is, you should be able to run the following to create these two vectors:
```{r}
# Load files. These files were pulled from our own repository but originally downloaded from https://github.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets
valid_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecarlson5683/exercise-04/main/collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt"
solution_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecarlson5683/exercise-04/main/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt"

# Creating custom function "load_libaray"
load_library <- function(filename){
  library(tidyverse)
  read.table(filename, header = TRUE) %>% # create a tibble (data frame)
    pull(words) # ensure that only "words" is being pulled
}

valid_list <- load_library(valid_file)
solution_list <- load_library(solution_file)

str(valid_list)
str(solution_list)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
